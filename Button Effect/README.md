# 🌊 Button Ripple Effect

A simple and visually appealing **Button Ripple Animation** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
When the user hovers over the button, a colorful ripple expands outward — giving a smooth and modern interaction effect.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Smooth ripple animation on hover  
- Fully responsive and lightweight  
- Pure **CSS & JavaScript** (no external libraries)  
- Easy to integrate into any webpage or landing page

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Basic structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and animation using pseudo-elements  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Dynamic ripple position based on mouse location

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. The button uses a CSS `::before` pseudo-element to create the ripple.  
2. On every hover, JavaScript calculates the exact mouse coordinates (`xPos`, `yPos`).  
3. These values are passed into CSS custom properties (`--xPos`, `--yPos`),  
   making the ripple appear exactly where the cursor enters the button.
