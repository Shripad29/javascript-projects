# 🎨 Color Changer

An interactive and beginner-friendly web project that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on colored buttons. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project demonstrates core front-end development skills including DOM selection, event handling, and dynamic styling.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Each colored box is a clickable `span` element.
2. When clicked, JavaScript listens for the event and sets the `backgroundColor` of the `<body>` to the selected color.
3. This is done using simple DOM manipulation via `addEventListener`.
